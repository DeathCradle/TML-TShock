# Open Terraria API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API)

The Open Terraria API, known as OTAPI, is a unique low-level API for [Terraria](https://terraria.org) that exposes events and provides performance optimisations while supporting both client and server executables on all official platforms.

You can use this modification as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OTAPI/) to power your own project with minimal update downtime*, or you can build plugins for [NyxStudios' Orion](https://github.com/NyxStudios/Orion) which uses OTAPI under the hood.
